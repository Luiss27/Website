      <p class="pclass" align="Center"> I play basketball since i was in Grade 2, <br>
      I wanted to play in biggest leagues like PBA, NBA and FIBA to represent our country. <br>
    I played in Letran Intramuros for 2 years when i was in Grade 7 and Grade 8. <br> I was awarded as Mythical 5 last week in our League. <br>
  all i did was to work hard and play hard! <br>
My idol is Paul George. </p>
